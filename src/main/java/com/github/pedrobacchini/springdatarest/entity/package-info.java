/**
 * Defines common Id Generator that use PostgreSQL sequences properly.
 * It uses a separate sequence for the chosen ID, as opposed to using a single sequence for all IDs;
 * the same result can be achieved by simply using {@code @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)}, but
 * that way hibernate would use a sequence as an identity, which would decrease performance.
 * <p>
 * Generates a sequence for each entity "entityName_seq"
